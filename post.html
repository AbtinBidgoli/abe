                      "Our signature blend Bloomsbury is light golden in colour with a fine, persistent mousse. Citrus fruit aromas with hints of melon and honey. Chardonnay dominance brings finesse, along with crisp freshness. The Pinots add depth and character leading to a beautifully balanced finish. Will age gracefully over time as the Chardonnay matures." ~ Ridgeview Winery

                    <blockquote>
                      "A hint of nettle plays amidst the green apple and lemon notes of the nose. The palate has very fine fizz that gently exudes even more green-apple and bright lemon notes. This is slender, taut and lively, and makes an ideal apéritif style delivering real, lasting and resounding refreshment."

                    <blockquote>
                      "The Bloomsbury was disgorged in November 2019. This is the signature cuvée from Ridgeview, and it was served to the Queen at her official Diamond Jubilee celebration. It is always a reliable performer, bursting with citrus lemon, lime, freshly sliced melon and honeysuckle. The energetic palate revives the senses, thanks to a vibrant line of acidity that imparts almost a steeliness toward the finish (not unlike a Blanc de Blancs.) This is great introduction to the delights of Ridgeview and indeed to English sparkling wine."

                    <blockquote>
                      "Chardonnay dominates this blend with pinot noir and meunier, providing a richer wine than Ridgeview’s Cavendish, big and leesy, with fleshiness to its fruit. The autolysis lends a toasty pastry-crust note while the savory chardonnay spice brings to mind fennel seeds and meaty stock. It’s substantial enough for braised rabbit or hare."

                        >By: Joan Didion
                      </a>
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                      From Didion's husband, the writer John Gregory Dunne, died of a heart attack, just after they had returned from the hospital where their only child, Quintana, was lying in a coma. This book is a memoir of Dunne's death, Quintana's illness, and Didion's efforts to make sense of a time when nothing made sense. "She's a pretty cool customer," one hospital worker says of her, and, certainly, coolness was always part of the addictive appeal of Didion's writing. The other part was the dark side of cool, the hyper-nervous awareness of the tendency of things to go bad. In 2004, Didion had her own disasters to deal with, and she did not, she feels, deal with them coolly, or even sanely. This book is about getting a grip and getting on; it's also a tribute to an extraordinary marriage.
                    </blockquote>
                    <blockquote>
                      Many will greet this taut, clear-eyed memoir of grief as a long-awaited return to the terrain of Didion's venerated, increasingly rare personal essays. The author of Slouching Towards Bethlehem and 11 other works chronicles the year following the death of her husband, fellow writer John Gregory Dunne, from a massive heart attack on December 30, 2003, while the couple's only daughter, Quintana, lay unconscious in a nearby hospital suffering from pneumonia and septic shock. Dunne and Didion had lived and worked side by side for nearly 40 years, and Dunne's death propelled Didion into a state she calls "magical thinking." "We might expect that we will be prostrate, inconsolable, crazy with loss," she writes. "We do not expect to be literally crazy, cool customers who believe that their husband is about to return and need his shoes." Didion's mourning follows a traditional arc—she describes just how precisely it cleaves to the medical descriptions of grief—but her elegant rendition of its stages leads to hard-won insight, particularly into the aftereffects of marriage. "Marriage is not only time: it is also, paradoxically, the denial of time. For forty years I saw myself through John's eyes. I did not age." In a sense, all of Didion's fiction, with its themes of loss and bereavement, served as preparation for the writing of this memoir, and there is occasionally a curious hint of repetition, despite the immediacy and intimacy of the subject matter. Still, this is an indispensable addition to Didion's body of work and a lyrical, disciplined entry in the annals of mourning literature.
