                      Improving UX maturity requires growth & evolution across 4
                      high-level factors: strategy, culture, process, &
                      outcomes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      One tool is to estimate the UX maturity: high (set up for
                      systematic success) or low maturity (mostly fail, & ship
                      bad design, unless you're lucky). Our UX-maturity model
                      has 6 stages that cover processes, design, research,
                      leadership support, & longevity of UX.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Definition</h3>
                    <p>
                      <b>UX maturity</b> measures an organization’s desire &
                      ability to successfully deliver user-centered design. It
                      encompasses the quality & consistency of research & design
                      processes, resources, tools, & operations, as well as the
                      organization’s propensity to support & strengthen UX now &
                      in the future, through its leadership, workforce, &
                      culture.
                    </p>
                    <h3>The UX-Maturity Model</h3>
                    <p>
                      The UX-maturity model provides a framework to assess each
                      organization’s UX-related strengths & weaknesses. We can
                      use that assessment to determine which of the 6 stages an
                      organization currently occupies. Further, this model
                      provides insights about how an organization can increase
                      its UX maturity.
                    </p>
                    <p>The 6 stages of UX maturity are:</p>
                    <ol type="i">
                      <li><b>Absent</b> ~ UX is ignored or nonexistent</li>
                      <br />
                      <li>
                        <b>Limited</b> ~ UX work is rare, done haphazardly, &
                        lacking importance
                      </li>
                      <br />
                      <li>
                        <b>Emergent</b> ~ The UX work is functional & promising
                        but done inconsistently & inefficiently
                      </li>
                      <br />
                      <li>
                        <b>Structured</b> ~ The organization has semisystematic
                        UX-related methodology that is widespread, but with
                        varying degrees of effectiveness & efficiency
                      </li>
                      <br />
                      <li>
                        <b>Integrated</b> ~ UX work is comprehensive, effective,
                        & pervasive
                      </li>
                      <br />
                      <li>
                        <b>User-driven</b> ~ Dedication to UX at all levels
                        leads to deep insights & exceptional
                        user-centered–design outcomes
                      </li>
                      <br />
                    </ol>
                    <br />
                    <div class="media">
                      <img
                        src="img/nng-ux-maturity-levels-37.png"

                    <p>
                      The UX-Maturity Model incorporates new norms & adapts to
                      the evolution of our industry. It outlines how UX maturity
                      can be shaped & measured. However, companies at the same
                      stage might look different due to organization specifics
                      such as size priorities, or politics.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Factors in UX Maturity</h3>
                    <p>
                      Improving UX maturity requires growth & evolution across
                      several different factors, including:
                    </p>
                    <ol type="I">
                      <li>
                        <b>Strategy</b> ~ UX leadership, planning, & resource
                        prioritization
                      </li>
                      <br />
                      <li>
                        <b>Culture</b> ~ Knowledge about & attitudes towards UX,
                        as well as cultivating UX careers & practitioners’
                        growth
                      </li>
                      <br />
                      <li>
                        <b>Process</b> ~ Systematic, efficient use of UX
                        research & design methods
                      </li>
                      <br />
                      <li>
                        <b>Outcomes</b> ~ Intentional definition of goals &
                        measurement of the results produced by UX work
                      </li>
                      <br />
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                      None of these factors stand alone; rather, they reinforce
                      & enable each other. Knowledge of UX processes does not
                      create a great UX team if UX work is not prioritized by
                      the organization’s leadership; likewise, belief in the
                      value of UX only becomes actionable when there are
                      methodologies in place to ‘practice what you preach.’
                      Organizations must progress in all these dimensions in
                      order to reach high levels of UX maturity & realize the
                      full value of user-centered design.
                    </p>
                    <div class="media">
                      <img
                        src="img/nng-factors-of-ux-maturity.png"
                        alt="com.abtinbidgoli ~ UX/UI Developer"
                        class="img-rounded"
                        lazy
                      />
                    </div>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                      Each of these 4 high-level factors influence the
                      organization’s UX-maturity level. These factors provide a
                      framework to assess the organization’s commitment to UX &
                      its ability to deliver user-centered products & services
                      across all areas of the organization.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Strategy</h3>
                    <p>
                      Strategy includes all high-level decisions & planning that
                      contribute to the success of UX work before it begins.
                      There is always a different method or strategy that could
                      be used to get an effective, positive result. However,
                      unlike a vision, strategic plans offer a systematic,
                      sequential strategy for getting to the future. This
                      includes specific, quantifiable objectives.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Having said that, strategy can be broken down into 3
                      subfactors:
                    </p>
                    <ol type="A">
                      <li>
                        <b>Vision</b> ~ One or more declared user-centered
                        organizational objectives that guide internal,
                        crossdisciplinary decision making are key to UX
                        maturity. This subfactor considers whether things like
                        yearly objectives, crossdepartmental alignment, &
                        leadership are UX-oriented.
                      </li>
                      <br />
                      <li>
                        <b>Logistics</b> ~ In order for UX work to prosper, UX
                        efforts should be accounted for & prioritized,
                        throughout the product lifecycle. This subfactor
                        accounts for whether aspects like development schedules
                        & processes, operationalized systems, & standardized
                        decision making take UX into account.
                      </li>
                      <br />
                      <li>
                        <b>Budget</b> ~ Organizations must allocate adequate
                        resources ~ people & time ~ to UX & invest in future UX
                        initiatives.
                      </li>
                      <br />
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                      In <b>low-maturity</b> organizations (stages 1–3), a
                      vision that includes UX is rare (or if it even exists,
                      isn’t well-communicated). In
                      <b>high-maturity</b> organizations (stages 4–6), a vision
                      includes strong, thorough user-centered ideas, is
                      deliberately & strategically communicated, & guides the
                      entire organization (UXers & everybody else).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <b>Low-maturity</b> organizations’ schedules & development
                      processes seldom mention UX, & if they do, UX is used to
                      validate or improve existing designs, rather than drive
                      new ones. In contrast, <b>high-maturity</b> organizations
                      implement a shared method for project prioritization,
                      regularly track user-experience quality, & allow good
                      research to drive projects.

                      thinly across multiple product teams.

                    <p>
                      Every company & organization has its own unique
                      personality & culture. Until changes sink deeply into an
                      organization’s culture ~ a process that can sometimes take
                      years ~ new approaches are fragile & subject to
                      regression. The opportunity to create organizational
                      culture ~ a culture built around sound business ethics,
                      helps assess the culture & associated strengths,
                      weaknesses, & potential opportunities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Culture encompasses ideas that contribute to the
                      organization’s understanding of the purpose & value of UX.

                      In <b>low-maturity</b> organizations, the UX mindset
                      usually doesn’t exist or if it does, there is
                      leader-to-leader discrepancy & many think UX is just
                      polish at the end of product development. In
                      <b>high-maturity</b> organizations, there is a broad
                      understanding that UX impacts products & services from the
                      inception phase & applies beyond interfaces. In fact, a UX
                      skillset often plays an equal role (& might be a
                      prerequisite) alongside other skillsets.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <b>Low-maturity</b> organizations have leaders who are
                      indifferent to UX & struggle with a lack of respect for
                      the future-oriented aspects of UX (for example, discovery
                      research) & inconsistent buy-in for UX across leaders &
                      colleagues. In contrast,
                      <b>high-maturity</b> organizations have strong assistance
                      for good UX across teams, UX is well-respected among
                      peers, & there is UX expertise & support at the highest
                      level (C-suite).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      In <b>low-maturity</b> organizations, there are usually no
                      dedicated UX roles or titles. If there are any, the people
                      in those roles cannot effectively sustain their work
                      because they are part of teams that are not UX-minded.
                      These organizations also often miss specific skillsets
                      needed to establish UX basics like benchmarking or
                      qualitative research. As organizations evolve to be
                      <b>high-maturity</b>, human-resources elements (like job
                      profiles & career paths) not only exist but cover a wide
                      range of UX skills. Hires are made to specific UX-roles
                      depending on team needs & UXers are encouraged to grow
                      their skillset through mentorship & additional training.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <b>Low-maturity</b> organizations are often rigid when it
                      comes to adjusting processes in order to incorporate a UX
                      mindset or respond to new UX challenges. They may adopt
                      some UX-oriented workflows but apply them undiscerningly &
                      be unwilling to change them when facing new UX challenges
                      or problems. They may also not have the capabilities or
                      the knowledge to change their processes due to
                      understaffing or lack of specialized UX expertise. Their
                      UX practice may depend on one or two people; if these
                      people leave the company, the practice dies. In

                      willingness & logistical ability to adjust processes based
                      on the context & needs of the team. If personnel changes,
                      the product team can continue without having to start from

                      <b>Low-maturity</b> organizations suffer from a lack of
                      methods, often used incorrectly. Also, in such
                      organizations, UX methods are frequently used in response
                      to a specific business need, rather than being embedded
                      into everyday work. Research is limited to ‘easy’ methods
                      instead of appropriate methods; findings from research
                      rarely lead to design changes. In comparison, in
                      <b>high-maturity</b> organizations, a variety of design &
                      research methods are used across the entire development
                      lifecycle. Iterative design is common & discovery research
                      is a prerequisite for most projects. Extremely
                      high-maturity organizations may even create new methods or

                    <p>
                      <b>Low-maturity</b> organizations don’t realize that
                      crossfunctional teams should be involved in UX; rather,
                      they think that only those with “UX” in their title should
                      be responsible for UX. In these cases, inconsistent
                      success metrics make collaboration difficult & cause it to
                      occur only for part of the development process. In
                      <b>high-maturity</b> organizations, collaboration is
                      embedded in the company’s DNA. UX professionals routinely
                      cooperate with other roles & most teams perform regular

                      The only common thread related to UX in

                      research. Frameworks exist across the organization & are
                      shared, maintained, & improved. This approach ultimately

                      This factor highlights the result of UX research & design.
                      These outcomes of UX work should be intentionally defined
                      by establishing clear UX goals & objectives that are

                      rather than usability & user needs. In
                      <b>high-maturity</b>
                      organizations, the success of the design is based on how
                      much it answers the project goals & meets real user needs.

                      <b>Low-maturity</b> organizations usually chase metrics
                      that have nothing to do with the user. Even if they do
                      have a few token user-centered metrics, there is no system
                      in place to track them. <b>High-maturity</b> organizations
                      have user-centered goals that drive metric creation. These
                      metrics are effective at measuring UX, encompass aspects
                      of the entire user journey, are monitored & updated, & are
                      used at the highest leadership level.

                      However, in practice, things are a little more nuanced. In
                      some organizations, certain factors may carry more weight
                      than others. For example, in extremely traditional,
                      hierarchical companies, <b>Strategy</b> may impact an
                      organization more than process (due to leadership being
                      more likely to play a role in dictating process standards
                      that are respected & followed). Inversely, in startups,
                      where there is little strategic planning & a quickly
                      evolving vision, the <b>Process</b> factor (& its
                      subfactors) may play a larger role in the overall
                      maturity.

                      Given this contextual complexity, a complete evaluation of
                      an organization’s UX maturity should be based on diverse,
                      company-tailored assessment methods, including conducting
                      research, observing work practices, interviewing &
                      surveying employees at different levels in the
                      organization, analysis of processes, people, tools, &
                      deliverables.

                        they are talismans, objects consecrated by memory. They
                        have magical properties & they are not to be lightly
                        disposed of or given away, because in losing them we
                        lose a part of our memory, & memories are the bricks of
                        the houses of our selves, our lives.</i

                      salesman and a stay-at-home mom, public school-educated,
                      jailed at seventeen on a bogus petty robbery charge,

                      boy for Time, writer for The National Observer, et cetera.
                      From the outset he was the Wild Man of American journalism
                      with a journalistic appetite that touched on subjects that
                      drove his sense of justice and intrigue, from biker gangs
                      and 1960s counterculture to presidential campaigns and
                      psychedelic drugs. He lived larger than life and pulled it
                      up around him in a mad effort to make it as electric,
                      anger-ridden, and drug-fueled as possible.
