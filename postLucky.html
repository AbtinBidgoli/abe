                      Unfortunately life isn't a level playing field, everyone
                      has different strengths & weaknesses inherently, not to
                      mention circumstances being different. <i>Luck</i> is the
                      residue of due diligence, fair play & unfair advantages.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      In any situation where a single event can create massive
                      good luck, you simply need to maximize your exposure to
                      possible good luck situations & wait for one to come
                      along.

                      >
                      is one of the most successful books ever written, having
                      sold over 80 million copies since being published in 2003.
                      But Dan Brown, the author, struggled leading up to it.

                      >, the three books he published before The Da Vinci Code,
                      each originally sold less than 10,000 copies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      When you read them, you’ll notice something interesting:
                      The Da Vinci Code isn’t a clearly better book than the
                      rest. If you were to take all four, give them to a group
                      of people unfamiliar with Dan Brown’s work, & ask them
                      which of the four would go on to be an international
                      bestseller, it’s unlikely that they would be able to
                      predict Da Vinci Code with reliable accuracy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      So what’s the difference? Why did Da Vinci Code succeed
                      where the other three failed? Once a book passes a tipping
                      point, the sales are self-propagating from lists,
                      interviews, & articles. But getting to that tipping point,
                      as with reaching any massive success, that requires a bit
                      of luck.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Definition of Getting Lucky</h3>
                    <p>
                      What does “getting lucky” even mean? We typically use it
                      to explain away someone’s success or status, as a way to
                      make us feel better for not hitting that same level, or to
                      justify inaction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      If you check Instagram & your friend is suddenly
                      galavanting around the world after their boutique poodle
                      scarves went viral, you might say they “just got lucky” to
                      justify why they get to have fun while you’re stuck behind
                      a desk making PowerPoint presentations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      While they likely did get a little lucky (I imagine the
                      poodle scarf market is very competitive), you can’t
                      attribute your differences in outcomes to that luck. The
                      reason they got lucky & you didn’t is that
                      <b
                        >they exposed themselves to more opportunities to get
                        lucky</b
                      >.
                    </p>
                    <div class="media">
                      <img
                        src="img/ABcanonT70modelT1917.jpg"

                        class="img-rounded"
                        lazy
                      />
                    </div>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                      Let’s imagine the best case scenario for another one of
                      our PowerPoint-presenting friends. They do their job, work
                      hard, & when (if) they get recognized for their efforts,
                      they get a nice bonus, say, 10%, & a raise of 20% for the
                      next year.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      This is their best case, & even that requires a bit of
                      luck. They had to get on a project where they could show
                      their talents, needed a manager they got along with, etc.
                      The maximum good luck they exposed themselves to was the
                      10% bonus & 20% raise. There was no possibility of getting
                      <i>super</i> lucky & suddenly doubling their daily income,
                      but there is the possibility of getting unlucky & losing
                      all of their income.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The poodle scarf designer, though, has a significantly
                      higher range of potentially lucky outcomes. She might not
                      increase her income at all in a year, but if Oprah
                      suddenly decides to get a poodle & that it needs a
                      wardrobe of scarves, our friend’s income could go up
                      1,000% in one month. While you could be annoyed that you
                      didn’t get lucky in the same way your friend did, you
                      can’t complain.
                      <b
                        >You didn’t give yourself the same opportunities to get
                        lucky</b
                      >.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Negative vs. Positive Luck Exposure</h3>
                    <p>
                      I particularly like to drive, although that might not be
                      everyone's purview. Every time you get into a car, there
                      is no chance of something incredibly good happening to you
                      (specific to getting in the car), but there are many
                      things incredibly bad that could happen to you. A small
                      child could run out & become your hood ornament, you could
                      hit some ice & skid into a wall, it could break down & run
                      you $2,000 in repairs. There is a chance (albeit very low)
                      that something very bad will happen every time you get in
                      a car,
                      <b
                        >but there is almost no chance of something great
                        happening</b
                      >. Your total luck exposure for car driving is
                      net-negative.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Now let’s look at the PowerPoint wizard through a similar
                      lens. They can get unlucky in one massive way: getting
                      fired, but they can only get lucky in much smaller ways:
                      getting a raise, bonus, or promotion. The biggest way they
                      can get lucky is in getting another job, but even that is
                      unlikely to more than double their income unless they make
                      a move like associate to partner.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Their luck exposure is somewhere between negative,
                      neutral, or very-low-positive. While it’s more likely that
                      a good thing will happen in a given time period, the bad
                      thing is significantly worse when or if it happens.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      So let’s consider the poodle scarf manufacturer again.
                      Assuming she built her business intelligently, didn’t make
                      an insane upfront investment, & dropships her orders,
                      she’s never exposed to a large potential loss. She could
                      have even taken the first round of orders & used those to
                      fund the first round of production, never taking a
                      financial risk at all. With her business staying steady,
                      she’s never exposed to a huge loss, since the worst thing
                      that could happen is no sales come in, in which case she
                      places no orders. A small chance for a small loss.

                    <h3>How to Expose Yourself to Good Luck</h3>
                    <p>
                      If you want to get lucky in anything, then you need to
                      maximize your positive luck exposure while minimizing your
                      negative luck exposure.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      To maximize your positive luck exposure, work & play in
                      domains where a good luck event can have a massive impact.
                      Your boss is unlikely to walk in & say “Congrats! You get
                      a 1,000% raise today!” but if you write a book & it hits
                      the NYT list you could certainly see a 1,000% earnings
                      increase. Dan Brown likely received something on the order
                      of a 100,000% increase.

                      A product that can provide a large return that is not
                      linearly tied to the time put into it is significantly
                      more likely to lead to massive financial luck.

                      Some domains that are open to massive sudden good luck
                      (positive black swans):
                    </p>
                    <ol type="i">
                      <li><b>Income</b> (entrepreneurs, creatives)</li>
                      <br />
                      <li>Books or albums sold</li>
                      <br />
                      <li><b>Website visits</b></li>
                      <br />
                      <li>Social (Instagram, LinkedIn, etc.) connections</li>
                      <br />
                      <li><b>Company valuation</b></li>
                      <br />
                      <li>App downloads</li>

                      <li>People met (quality)</li>
                      <br />
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                      The most important quality of these domains is that there
                      is <b>no linear relationship between time & success</b>.
                      They “scale” better than their lower exposure
                      counterparts. You could put a ton of time in & fail, but
                      you could also put in a salaried person’s time for an
                      inordinate amount of success.

                      Then there are the domains with no, or very little,
                      opportunities for massive sudden good luck:
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Moving out of limited good luck domains into potentially
                      massively lucky ones isn’t enough, though. Once you’re in
                      those high good luck potential domains, you still need to
                      act in ways that increase your likelihood of having a
                      massive good luck event.
                    </p>
                    <h3>How to Get the Good Luck Events</h3>
                    <p>
                      Dan Brown’s first three books failed (until Da Vinci Code
                      succeeded & brought them with it), but each of them had a
                      chance at hitting the bestsellers list. With each new
                      book, he created another opportunity to get suddenly
                      massively lucky, & each new book <i>increased</i> the odds
                      since he brought some of his existing audience with him
                      from one to the next
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Intelligent entrepreneurs rarely sit in a room, think of a
                      company idea, & then go build it with no deviation from
                      the plan. They are constantly testing ideas, seeing what
                      works & what doesn’t, & exposing themselves to
                      opportunities for their business to take off while quickly
                      killing off the parts that don’t.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      You could approach writing the same way. Each article you
                      publish is an opportunity for your site to suddenly become
                      massively popular. Odds are that 20% of your articles will
                      contribute 80%+ of your traffic, so each new one you
                      publish could be the one that goes viral & puts you on the
                      map.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The luck-seeker increases his or her odds of getting lucky
                      by
                      <b
                        >creating as many opportunities as reasonably possible
                        for good luck to strike</b
                      >. So long as luck is at play, you cannot simply put one
                      thing out there & hope it does well. You can’t try just
                      one business idea, can’t write just one book, can’t
                      publish just one article. You have to keep going, assume
                      that some things will perform while others won’t (for
                      reasons you’ll never understand), & wait.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      But the same principles of action can apply in a domain
                      that domain isn’t prone to sudden massive luck. On the
                      off-chance that you saw the title & thought I was going to
                      tell you how to get laid, well, this plays in there as
                      well.

                      <i>Luck</i> is the residue of due diligence, fair play &
                      unfair advantages. In any situation where a single event
                      can create massive good luck, you simply need to maximize
                      your exposure to possible good luck situations & wait for
                      one to come along.

                      ~ food. Bronson is this era’s Homer, and F*ck, That’s
                      Delicious is a modern-day Odyssey, replete with orgiastic
                      recipes, world travel, siren songs, and weed.

                      world’s most coveted five-star temples of gastronomy. And
                      the tacos in LA. The best Dominican chimis. Jamaican jerk.
