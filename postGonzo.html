                      When I think back on first
                      reading Thompson's <i>Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas: A Savage Journey to the Heart of the American Dream</i>, it's
                      the fevered moments of paranoia &
                      debauchery tripping off the page like
                      some kind of drug-induced sweat that I
                      remember best. What I don't remember is
                      the winner of the Mint 400 Desert Race
                      that was held in Las Vegas during March
                      of 1971, but that was the original 250
                      word photo caption assignment that
                      Thompson was hired to covered by Sports
                      Illustrated during his time in Las Vegas.

                      <blockquote>
                        “Hunter was a man’s man and had been from his childhood. He was large, strong, and dominant. He smoked cigarettes and drank, drove fast, and attracted beautiful women. He rode motorcycles and took risks. He knew how to fight and how to intimidate people verbally to avoid a fight.”

                        Having said that, Thompson instead delivered a
                      vicious commentary on the <i>American Dream</i>
                      with himself right smack dab in the
                      middle. The unique blend of
                      autobiographical incidents with pure
                      fiction as a form of journalism is
                      called <mark>Gonzo Journalism</mark>. While in the Air Force, Thompson taught himself the basic
                      principles of journalism: truth, accuracy,
                      impartiality, accountability & the
                      ever-important who, what, when, where & why.

                      <blockquote>
                        “Hunter was born and raised in Louisville, Kentucky. His family had been in Kentucky for generations, and there are names like Semeranis Lawless and America Hook in our Thompson family tree. He sometimes called himself <i>nothing but a smart hillbilly</i>. He was born in 1937 and had two brothers, Davison and Jim, both younger. His father was an insurance salesman, and his mother was a stay-at-home mom until his father died suddenly when he was a teenager and she had to go to work. He attended public school, read constantly, spent time with the children of Louisville’s Old Money families, and scraped through high school not due to lack of intelligence but because of boredom and hostility to authority. He also got into a fair amount of trouble, so that at age seventeen he spent thirty days in the county jail for a bogus petty robbery charge. It would have been sixty days except the judge gave him the option of joining the Air Force in return for the reduced sentence."

                      <blockquote>“He enlisted and was initially trained to be a radio technician. He despised everything about the military and probably would have spent four years in solitary confinement for chronic and unrepentant insubordination if he hadn’t managed to lie his way into a job as the sports editor for the base newspaper, The Command Courier. This made all the difference. He worked his own hours (slept late, worked late), came and went as he pleased, did unauthorized freelance writing for a local civilian paper, and wrote entertaining, flattering, and wildly exaggerated articles about the base sports teams. This curried favor with the base commander, who in turn excused Hunter from the customary airman duties and shielded him from the constant complaints of other officers. In this way he survived three years of the Air Force, got an early honorable discharge, and gained some solid experience as a journalist. He also understood that he wanted to be a writer, and a damn good one. Not a journalist, but a novelist, like Hemingway or Fitzgerald.”

I was constantly doing things that violated regulations. An apparently uncontrollable iconoclast, I was discharged today
after one of the most hectic and unusual Air Force careers in recent history.” ~ HST

                        After the Air Force, Thompson took
freelance opportunities from various
journals & newspapers, but by the age
of 21, he had already grown contempt with
journalism as a profession. In a job
seeking cover letter to the Vancouver
Sun, Thompson wrote for & shockingly
was not hired.

                        “After his discharge, he held a couple of brief jobs on newspapers on the East Coast, including a stint as a copy boy at Time magazine. He was either fired from or quit each of these jobs, and soon realized he would never be able to work in an office for a boss, that he wasn’t wired for it. It became clear to him that working as a salaried journalist was not going to allow him to be the kind of writer that he wanted to be. So, he became a freelance journalist, at starvation wages, but with the freedom to work on his own terms.

                      Thompson first garnered
acclaim for his article, <i>the Motorcycle
  Gangs Losers & Outsiders</i> for the
magazine the Nation, which was later
expanded into the novel <i>Hells Angels: the
  Strange & Terrible Saga of the Outlaw
  Motorcycle Gangs</i>. The book detailed
  Thompson's experiences living with the
  Hells Angels, a notorious motorcycle club
  based in California. He spent a year
  embedded with one specific chapter,
  learning their unique subculture &
  lifestyle. The novel was praised for its
  up-close & uncompromising look into a
  unique world that was feared by the
  general public.
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                      “Hunter was curious to know the real story, and proposed that he write a magazine article on the Hells Angels. He ended up spending around six months with the Oakland chapter, not as a member but as a journalist who wanted to know their story. Though he ended up getting stomped by the gang for allegedly betraying the terms of the financial deal he had with them, he had gotten the material he needed. In his book he portrays them as neither devils nor revolutionaries but as mostly small-time hoodlums and drifters with very limited options, unallied to any ideology or greater movement. Though the book was nonfiction, it wasn’t purely objective. It was a story about Hunter and the Hells Angels and how he met them, dealt with them, rode with them, and learned about them, from his point of view.”

He looked at letter writing as not only a way to keep in touch and debate ideas, but as a writing exercise, so that when he wasn’t sleeping or in the bar with friends, he was writing. He moved constantly, went through a long string of old and worn-out cars, slept during the day and worked at night, borrowed money (and lent it when he had it), stayed one step ahead of the bill collectors, and left a trail of small-time debt across the country. He also kept carbon copies of everything he wrote in neatly organized and carefully labeled folders.”

<p>
  Having now made a name for himself,
Thompson took a writing assignment with
the rebellious & short-lived magazine
Scanlan's Monthly, to go back to his
hometown of Louisville & report on the
famous Kentucky Derby race. The final
result inadvertently defined a whole
new kind of journalism, <mark>Gonzo Journalism</mark>
& solidified Thompson's writing style
moving forward.
</p>
<h3>So What Exactly is Gonzo Journalism</h3>
<blockquote>
  “I went to the base library and found three
books on journalism.
I stayed there reading them until it closed.
Basic journalism.
I learned about headlines, leads: who, when, what, where, that sort of thing.
I barely slept that night.
This was my ticket to ride, my ticket to get out of that damn place.” ~ HST
</blockquote>
<p>Basically it's subjective
journalism where the writer becomes a
part of the story via a first-person
narrative. Rather than focusing on the
subject of the piece, the writer instead
becomes the star of the story as they
share their experiences & beliefs
through use of sarcasm, humor &
exaggeration. Traditional journalism is
all about delivering objective facts
through neutral language ~ <i>who what when where why</i> ~ raw dry
facts that can be verified by third parties ~ tell, don't show.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      In contrast,
                      <mark>Gonzo Journalism</mark> is ~ show, don't tell. It's
                      more about getting the feel of the
                      events or places the writer is covering
                      & from the author's perspective &
                      opinions blossoms social critique in
                      satire. The fact that the author was
                      reporting on a story becomes the story
                      itself. The final product gives the
                      appearance of stream-of-consciousness
                      reporting, but it's not. It's still
                      journalism with standards of accuracy
                      & grammar, disconnected thoughts are
                      judiciously trimmed in ordered to create
                      a precisely tailored story.

                      “In 1970, Hunter covered the Kentucky Derby for a short-lived magazine called Scanlan’s and wrote what turned out to be his first piece of <mark>Gonzo Journalism</mark>, a word coined by a fellow writer to describe Hunter’s unique combination of first-person subjectivity, factual reporting, and hyperbole written in raw, powerful prose. The word <i>Gonzo</i> eventually became synonymous with both Hunter’s writing and his lifestyle.”

                      capturing the essence of people &
                      places would become just as vital to the
                      DNA of <mark>Gonzo Journalism</mark> as Hunter 
                      Thompson. Having said that, their long relationship
                      began at the Kentucky Derby. After a long
                      weekend of heavy drinking &
                      disconnected thoughts & observations
                      scribbled into his notebook, Thompson
                      returned to New York to write the story.
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                      More specifically, Thompson stated that <mark>Gonzo Journalism</mark> is a style of reporting that bases
itself on William Faulkner’s idea “that the best fiction is far more true than any
kind of journalism and the best journalists have always know this.”

                    <p>
                      Immediately he was plagued with fears
that he didn't have any kind of coherent
story & a looming deadline. In an act
of pure desperation, Thompson took the
few draft pages he had written, inserted
scribbled pages from his notebook &
sent them to the magazine along with
Ralph Steadman sketches. Thompson was so
embarrassed by his own irresponsibility
that he wrote an apology letter to the
editor:
                    </p>

                      He was
                      certain he'd never worked for another
                      major publication again, but when the
                      article was published it changed the
                      landscape of journalism forever. <i>The

                      days before & after the Derby
                      all through the eyes of Hunter
                      Thompson. Written under duress & sketched with
                      eyebrow pencil & lipstick by Ralph Steadman, 
                      he provided up-close views of
                      activities in the Derby infield &

                      In
the story
Thompson serves as a Virgil like guide
leading Ralph Steadman deeper & deeper
into the hell,
that is the Kentucky Derby. The focus of
the article wasn't the dry facts of who
won the race, in fact out of a 7,000 word
story only one sentence mentions the
winner of the race. Instead their focus
was on the crowd.

                      By the
end of the piece, once Thompson &
Steadman have fully immersed themselves
in the raucous atmosphere of alcoholism
& violence, they painfully realized
that they have become the very savages
they originally planned to satirize.

                      That's an important aspect of <mark>Gonzo Journalism</mark> that is often overlooked by
imitators. Underneath the alcohol, drugs
& vulgarity, Thompson was always
communicating a deeper message to the
audience. A social critique, a political
agenda, a commentary on our culture &
that's exactly what he did with his
Kentucky Derby article. We're able to
experience Thompson's schizophrenic view
of America at a time of great turmoil.
Thompson makes a point to reference
President Nixon, the Vietnam War, the Kent
State shootings, the Black Panthers &
the failing economy. Albeit they
aren't the main focus of the article,
their brief mentions color in the
backdrop of a country becoming unglued
& give a sobering perspective to a
simple horse race happening in the
middle of Louisville, Kentucky.

                      The term gonzo still permeates our culture
today & it's all thanks to the
brilliantly bizarre mind of Hunter S.
Thompson. Hopefully I'll behave & think of good deeds, thoughts & endeavors. I indulge in discovering the works of <i>Hunter S. Thompson</i>. My perceived value from Hunter is to take control of your own life, don't be at the beckoning call of any institution or other excuses. Freedom is about personal freedom, you have the right to live & die. Having said that, I never thought about being born into this world, so I guess I'll stop thinking about the day I will die. A viable alternative I live vicariously through, to suppress my bad habits & transpose them into better ones. There's a moment when you ask what's next, & ask with full totality, therefore reach a fullness & just go. Having said that, lying is done with words, but also done with silence.

                    <blockquote>
                      “I learned that some cops lie. This was a brutal and profoundly disturbing realization: Those in control are not necessarily trustworthy. More importantly, authority is not necessarily to be obeyed, and certainly not feared. There is always a way to challenge authority, either in the courtroom or in the media or in the voting booth. He has done all of them many times, and usually successfully. In other words, he believes that it is possible to change a situation for the better, even in the face of entrenched authority.”

                      “<i>I Liked Jimmy Carter the first time I met him, and in the two years that have passed since that Derby Day in Georgia I have come to know him a hell of a lot better than I knew George McGovern at this point in the '72 campaign, and I still like Jimmy Carter. He is one of the most intelligent politicians I've ever met, and also one of the strangest. I have never felt comfortable around people who talk about their feeling for Jesus, or any other deity for that matter, because they are usually none too bright. . . Or maybe "stupid" is a better way of saying it; but I have never seen much point in getting heavy with either stupid people or Jesus freaks, just as long as they don't bother me. In a world as weird and cruel as this one we have made for ourselves, I figure anybody who can find peace and personal happiness without ripping off somebody else deserves to be left alone. They will not inherit the earth, but then neither will I. . . And I have learned to live, as it were, with the idea that I will never find peace and happiness, either. But as long as I know there's a pretty good chance I can get my hands on either one of them every once in a while, I do the best I can between high spots.</i>”
