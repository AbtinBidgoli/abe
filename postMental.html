                      My mother thinks she's an overzealous mom. I know what you’re thinking: <i>What a swell gal, How nice of her</i>. It sure was nice for the rest of the world, but it certainly wasn’t nice for me growing up. Having said that, these are first world problems, I can't complain.

                      Meanwhile at home, she was an absolute dictator. Everything that wasn’t done in her efficient way was scrutinized. That’s generous of me; truthfully, everything was scrutinized by both my parents. But the philanthropic scrutiny was always the most passionate agenda & thus the most frightening premise.

                      <mark>THIS IS A MEMOIR</mark>, a highly biased & unreliable memoir of the stories I coyly tell myself. It is filled with exaggerations, misstatements, faulty recollections, stoicism, omissions, chagrins & qualms. Discovering strings of words tucked between places of ecstasy & moments of pain. That is to say, I write to discover myself. It also contains a lot of truth about my demise, more truth than falsehoods, I believe.

                    <p>
                      If I am deceiving you, though, I am deceiving myself first of all. It’s just that all I have are memories, & memory is an incredulous thing, perfidious, as in unfaithful & tricky. Double-crossing & back-handed. Memory is not impartial. It is not a fair recorder, but instead a selective, inconsistent, & unreliable record being constantly reconsidered to compliment our needs & desires. Yet our lives & our identities are largely based on our memories, & we trust them unconditionally so we can draw our conclusions about our lives & the people in them. So we do the best we can, knowing we are finagling ourselves a good part of our lives. These are the stories I coyly tell myself.

                      I’m a complex man, far too complex for myself to completely know or understand. I was famous, almost worshipped in a few circles, unknown in most, but that’s the way I prefer. I was an alcoholic & stimulant fiend, a wild, angry, passionate, sometimes dangerous, charismatic, unpredictable, irresponsible, idealistic, sensitive man with a powerful & deeply rooted sense of justice. Good or bad, weak or strong, alive or dead, close or distant, our loved ones are always with us by virtue of memories. This is the story of how I went down the wrong path, & managed to find my way back before it was too late thanks to my loved ones.

                      Having said that, a story needs a starting place. In this story, the starting place is my parent’s early life, because I, like everyone, was to some degree a product of my upbringing.

                    <p>
                      My father was born in Rashte, Iran & my mother was born in Tehran, Iran, where they were both raised in Tehran, Iran. My parents fled Iran during the revolution to California in search of the <i>American Dream</i>. My parents graduated high school & were unavailable to attend College in Iran due to the revolution, but my mother pursued some Community College courses in Mission Hills. Being first generation immigrants without a college degree, they took any job they could to create an opportunity for brother & I to succeed.

                      I remember my dad always attempts to be funny to my friends in english, & most times would be, but in <i>Farsi</i> he is so good in the language his jokes are hysterical. Then I thought about my father’s struggles; immigrating from a third world country to Texas then to Los Angeles, learning a new language which his previous eloquent & articulate language doesn’t translate well, & all while raising a family. Damn, this is when I realized my young & dumb, awakening, & independence days are slowly coming to an end.

                      They say opposites attract, & my parents are the exact definition of opposite polarities. My mother grew up in an affluent family, daughter of Bank Executive while being match-made to my father, son of the Shah's assistant. I’m composed of contradictions, & so I am constantly at war with myself.

                    <p>
                      I hate everyone & everything, but I also feel bad for everyone & everything. I think I’m too loud but also too quiet. I don’t trust anyone, yet I trust everyone, arguably to the point of self-sabotage. I believe nothing matters & everything matters, that life is meaningless & also precious. I believe in nothing, but I also believe in the universe. I believe in sense, but I also believe in Allah. God makes no sense, yet God is somehow the only thing that makes sense. I’m not superstitious, but I believe in Allah so much that I actively try not to figure out the meaning of life, because I think if & when you do, God kills you.

                      It feels like a betrayal of my personality to believe in anything that isn’t backed up by a great deal of proof, but I believe in Allah because there is confirmation of Their existence everywhere we go with subliminals, double entendres & coincidences.
                    </p>
                    <p>Having said that, every time I have an interaction with my pops, it ultimately results in some sort of blow up. I finally realized where this stems from, lack of appreciation deriving from our Persian ego. Unfortunately its sad but we laid the groundwork for what we are, a dynamic I wouldn’t wish upon any of my enemies. Sometimes I won’t talk to him for a couple months, but its because of the resentment with my abandoned childhood. I owe my dad everything & acknowledge that, but I also learned that when I have kids I need to make that relationship stronger in order to have that bond & family feeling that I desire.</p>
                    
                    <p> I was missing that growing up, & luckily found it with my brother & in my friend’s families. It hurts me to say that my relationship with my dad is so disconnected, having said that we always had a cohesive family unit luckily. Is it too late to make my amends with my dad, maybe, maybe not, but my pain derives from my expectations. As a kid I always wanted him there but he was working from sunrise to sundown to support us. Out of all the basketball games I’ve played, I believe he’s only attended a single handful of games, while my mom still attended my intramural games at CSUN. The silver lining is that my dad made me the person I am today, flaws & sins, especially learning to cope with whatever the world throws at me personally. Plus, my family could be a lot worse, although we are a dysfunctional at times, we are still a close-knit family.</p>

                    <p>
                      I still am trying to learn not to snap whenever I speak to my dad, but my temper is running short with him. I bail so easy as soon as he starts talking in a belittling way, but I need to change my perspective & realize this is how his father interacted with my dad. Unfortunately when you aren’t happy with yourself, you project that unhappiness on other people. My dad is always scowling at people, complaining about anything he could think of. It is what it is, I got the hand I’m dealt & I'm truly grateful for my friends & family.

                      Do you believe in coincidences? I recently found out my grandmother’s birthday, Mansour Sabeti, is the same exact day as the great Kobe Bryant. I learned her full name checking into the hospital as she is always known as Madarbozourg, yet I still feel her when it gets cold. Transparency is something that seems to be a point of imperfection for my father. It's also my fault for not asking the right questions. Better late than never right. Having said that, another coincidence is that I have the same birthday as Capri Bryant, man this is too good to be true. Three times & then it's not a fluke.

                      “I think it was a combination of “doing the right thing” and consciously reinforcing the bonds among his community by inviting them to be part of a very important ceremony. When I attended my cousins’ weddings, which were large, traditional affairs, the parents’ friends were invited. It is so ironic that as a father Hunter passed on so few traditions, yet he possessed these traditional reflexes that would show themselves so unexpectedly.”

                      My mother’s attitude was always tolerable compared to my father & some of his frugal house rules that my family endured on a daily basis. My father on the other hand, peppers us with questions as soon as he can as if I'm guilty on third degree, I get no room to breathe as if he doesn't trust me. Turning on the air-conditioning past 78 was strictly forbidden. Not to mention growing up with dial up internet during middle school while play Call of Duty Zombies, mysteriously receiving calls from my so called friends, disconnecting the internet as their premise.

                      “Seeing my mom on the brink of complete sorrow was what made me almost lose it. There’s nothing more unsettling than seeing one of your parents afraid. The fear in their eyes is unrecognizable. They’ve been pretending for years to have it together and the moment you realize they don’t, it’s like being let in on a dark secret. Like how the government won’t reveal to the public that they know aliens exist because there would be chaos. If everyone knew parents were constantly afraid, it would be mayhem. If even one parent is scared, no one is safe.”

                      Albeit I'm not sure how many similar interests I have with my pops, I was always enthralled with my father's required military service in Iran. He claims to state this story that he was the best sharp shooter in his class. Having said that, he was often recruited to be the primary shooter at competitions, & even discretely shot for the multiple squads at the same competition.

The machining is so fine, the fit of the parts so precise, the movement of the parts so smooth. The gun itself can be a work of art, whatever you might think about its purpose, usefulness, or danger. For an admirer of the mechanical craft, a well-made gun is a thing of beauty. Hunter shared this appreciation for the machine itself. As I got older I came to appreciate the power, particularly of large handguns such as the Ruger .44 Magnum and the Freedom Arms .454 Casull.” ~ Curated Excerpt From: Juan F.

                      At some point, he realized how long my showers were, so he started monitoring everyone’s shower time. I guess my family held a grudge against me for ruining showers for us all. Complaining was the communication style of choice in my home. Nothing was going to get in the way of us doing “the minimal amount” in any endeavor.

                      It’s hard to question anything my parents says because they have no doubt in their mind that they are right about everything. As a result of never thinking & avoiding negativity, my parents fill the void of felt insecurity with optimism, hope & due diligence.

                    <blockquote>
                      The Artists' Prison looks askance at the workings of personality and privilege, sexuality, authority, and artifice in the art world. Imagined through the heavily redacted testimony of the prison's warden, written by Alexandra Grant, and powerfully allusive images by Eve Wood, the prison is a brutal, Kafkaesque landscape where creativity can be a criminal offence and sentences range from the allegorical to the downright absurd. In The Artists' Prison, the act of creating becomes a strangely erotic condemnation, as well as a means of punishment and transformation. It is in these very transformations ~ sometimes dubious, sometimes oddly sentimental ~ that the book's critical edge is sharpest.
                    </blockquote>
                    <blockquote>
                      In structural terms, The Artists' Prison represents a unique visual and literary intersection, in which Wood's drawings open spaces of potential meaning in Grant's text, and the text, in turn, acts as a framework in which the images can resonate and intensify in significance.
