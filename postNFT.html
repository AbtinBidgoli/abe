                      Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are digital assets that are
                      provably unique, creating digital scarcity. They can't be
                      duplicated or divided. They have many use cases, including
                      for digital collectibles, music, artwork, & in-game
                      tokens.

                      tokens… digital assets & their classifications are
                      multiplying & evolving right alongside cryptographic &
                      blockchain technology.

                      The Beeple "First 5,000 Days" NFT

                      purchaser really bought. Obviously, the buyer doesn’t own
                      the art in any traditional sense. Look, I can paste it
                      right here:
                    </p>

                      Before you say “you can do that with a painting too!”
                      That’s not quite true. A picture of a painting is
                      different from the painting. The JPG of the First 5,000
                      Days piece is the <i>piece</i>. There’s no difference.
                      This is one problem with the ownership debate around NFT
                      art (<a
                        href="https://decrypt.co/resources/non-fungible-tokens-nfts-explained-guide-learn-blockchain"

                        rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        >intro for the unfamiliar</a
                      >). You don’t own the artwork the same way you might own
                      an original Picasso. You can’t destroy it, you can’t
                      modify it, you don’t really control it in any special way.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      But that’s the thing with NFTs, you’re not buying the art.
                      You’re buying the NFT. The NFT is not the art. It’s a few
                      lines of codes that includes a reference to the art, but
                      that’s it. The art doesn’t even live in the NFT since it
                      would be way too much data to put on the Ethereum
                      blockchain. All the NFT has is a link to where the art is!
                    </p>

                      I could go make another NFT of the exact same piece of art
                      right now, & no one could really stop me.
                      <b>But it wouldn’t be worth anything.</b> Why not? Well,
                      for one, it wouldn’t have an authentic <b>origin</b>. It's
                      extremely easy to verify whether an NFT came from Beeple
                      or not. In fact, it's significantly easier to do this with
                      NFT art than with “real world” art since everything on the
                      Ethereum blockchain is legible. All Beeple would have to
                      do is tweet the public address he's signing his art from &
                      then anything of his that's signed by any other address
                      we'd know is fake.

                      Origin as the source of value is nothing new. Kanye West

                      <a
                        href="https://www.okayplayer.com/news/style-kanye-west-apc-120-plain-white-hiphop-t-shirt-sells-out.html"

                      because he’s Kanye West. Imagine how much he could sell
                      the white t-shirt he wore on stage for a show. It doesn’t
                      matter that we can buy a t-shirt for $5. Origin matters.
                      You might think of an NFT not as the art, but as the
                      signature on the art. Historically you had to own the
                      physical piece to have the signature. Now we can abstract
                      the signature into its own asset, & you can buy the
                      creator’s self-declared seal of authenticity.

                      Another analogy here is a college degree. Tuition at
                      Carnegie Mellon is $57,119 per year. At the end of four
                      years, you receive a piece of paper. Is that piece of
                      paper worth $228,476? You could just photoshop your name
                      into this one & call it a day:
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      But it’s not the piece of paper, it’s the origin of the
                      paper & what it tells people. The signature matters. It
                      tells people you spent 4 years & enough money to

                      learning… something. Hopefully. Therefore they should pay
                      you more than the otherwise indistinguishable student a
                      few miles away. The price of a degree is not about
                      knowledge or the friends you made along the way. Those
                      could be had for far less money. It’s about signaling.
                      Signaling you were competitive & affluent enough to get
                      into this institution, & then control your binge drinking
                      well enough to last for four years.

                      The college degree exists somewhere on the spectrum
                      between “utility” & “signaling.” One fairly consistent
                      truth with the utility to signal spectrum is that as
                      things get more expensive, we usually find ourselves
                      closer & closer to the signaling end of the spectrum. The
                      $5 t-shirt is pure utility. The Kanye t-shirt is almost
                      entirely signaling. Everything we buy, & own, falls
                      somewhere on this utility to signaling spectrum.

                    <p>
                      NFTs are fascinating in part because they take the utility
                      to signaling ratio to the extreme.

                      zero utility to owning NFTs that are on the market right
                      now, besides speculation about their future value. So
                      beyond speculation, why are they valuable? Signaling.
                      There are some

                      with over $1m USD in Bitcoin. If you suddenly came into a
                      few milly, you’d wanna show off too. NFTs are a fun new
                      way to signal wealth & taste.

                    <p>
                      But they’re also a way to signal how early you are in the
                      crypto economy. If you buy into the idea that NFTs will
                      set a new standard for digital rights management & digital
                      ownership (which I do, more on that next time), buying
                      some now is kind of like buying BTC back in 2013 or
                      registering a 3-letter domain name in the early days of
                      the web.

                    <p>
                      And to be clear, I absolutely love NFT technology & am
                      going to write about it much more. I’m not pointing out
                      their high signal to utility ratio to criticize them. I’m
                      pointing it out because I think they’re being unfairly
                      criticized for being a waste of money. Signaling is
                      extremely valuable, & NFTs are a fascinating new way to
                      peacock & maybe get rich along the way.

                      So are NFTs a bubble? I doubt it. NFTs are getting lots of
                      press but the market is still minuscule in the grand
                      scheme of things. The art market is worth ~ 67 billion
                      dollars. The NFT market only hit 338 million in 2020.
                      Maybe it’ll hit a few billion this year. But then factor
                      in how much easier it is to buy NFTs than art, & how many
                      other industries NFTs could eat away at, & that 67 billion
                      number just sounds like a starting point. For example,
                      sports merchandise. Some of the money getting spent on NBA
                      merch is now flowing into TopShot. TopShot has done at
                      least a few hundred million in transactions so far, which
                      sounds insane until you remember that NBA merchandise,
                      which has no speculative investing component, is a nearly

                    <p>
                      Or compare NFTs to other crypto options. Bitcoin’s market
                      cap is over 1 trillion. If there were a Beeple-sized, $69m
                      sale every single day for a year, the NFT market would
                      still be only $25b, or 2.5% of the Bitcoin market. It is
                      EARLY. While I don't think NFTs are a bubble, I think
                      there are much more interesting use cases for NFTs that
                      aren't being done yet. Uses that will take them beyond
                      mere signaling, & give them some new forms of utility that
                      weren't previously possible online. Once we start seeing
                      more of those use cases arrive, the market will just
                      continue to grow.
