                      Right, so let's say you want to get started with this
                      investing thing. You might have a bit of
                      <i>money</i> saved. It's probably not enough for a house,
                      but you reckon I should probably invest this in something.
                      Maybe you've heard on the news about <i>Tesla</i> or
                      <i>Costco</i> or <i>Amazon</i> & how, if you'd invested 10
                      years ago in <i>Tesla</i> then you'd be a millionaire by
                      now or things like that.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      If you try & look into this, you get all these acronyms
                      being thrown around like <i>Roth IRAs</i> &
                      <i>401Ks</i> in America or like <i>ISAs</i> or
                      <i>LISAs</i> in the UK. On top of that, there is the
                      anxiety that we all have that I know investing is
                      <i>risky</i> & I don't want to lose all of my
                      <i>money</i>. So in light of all of that, this is the
                      ultimate guide on how to get started with investing. It is
                      the article I wish I would have had five years ago when I
                      first started investing in stocks & <i>shares</i>. We're
                      gonna cover this by thinking about investing in 12
                      different byte size steps.
                    </p>
                    <h3>1. What happens to my <i>Money</i> over time?</h3>
                    <p>
                      So the first one is forgetting about investing completely
                      & just thinking what happens to my <i>money</i> over time
                      by default. If you've studied economics, you will know
                      that your <i>money</i> loses its value over time. Thanks
                      to something called <i>inflation</i>. <i>Inflation</i> is
                      generally around about the 2%-2.5% mark, so that means
                      that every year stuff costs about 2% more than it did the
                      year before. For example, in 1970, in America a cup of
                      coffee cost of 25 cents. But in 2019, that same cup of
                      coffee costs a $1 59. That is <i>inflation</i> in action.
                      So let's say you've got a thousand pounds in your hand
                      right now. For the next 10 years, you just stash it under
                      your mattress. If you never look at it again, in 10 years
                      time your thousand pounds is not gonna be worth a thousand
                      pounds anymore because everything would have increased by
                      2%ish every year. So the value of your <i>money</i> will
                      have fallen. So if you put your thousand pounds under your
                      mattress for 10 years, you will lose <i>money</i> over
                      time. This is obviously not good. Even if you put your
                      <i>money</i> in a savings account, like these days, a
                      savings account will give you like 0.2% interest which
                      means your <i>money</i> goes up by 0.2% every year. But
                      because <i>inflation</i> is up by 2% you're still losing
                      <i>money</i> over time. Again, this is not good.
                    </p>
                    <h3>
                      2. Stop <i>Money</i> from losing <i>Value</i> over time.
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                      Okay, so that begs the question which is key point number
                      two which is how do we stop our <i>money</i> from losing
                      value over time? The answer, albeit Allen Iverson is not a
                      wrong answer, is that if we had a hypothetical savings
                      account one that was let's say an interest rate of 2.5%
                      that would match roughly the rate of <i>inflation</i>. So
                      <i>inflation</i> means everything goes up by 2.5% in terms
                      of price. But our <i>money</i> in our savings account also
                      goes up by 2.5% each year. Therefore we're technically not
                      losing <i>money</i> over time. If you're watching this &
                      you have an issue with the word interest, don't worry
                      stick to it for now, investment is not the same as
                      interest but we'll come back to that a bit later. But the
                      point here is that we don't just want to not lose
                      <i>money</i> which is what happens at our 2.5% rate. We
                      actually want to make <i>money</i>.
                    </p>
                    <h3>3. How do I make <i>Money</i>?</h3>
                    <p>
                      That brings us on to question number three which is, well,
                      how do we actually make <i>money</i>? Now, let's go back
                      to our hypothetical savings account. If hypothetically, we
                      could have a savings account that was giving us a 10%
                      interest rate, this will never happen because that's just
                      way too high. But hypothetically if it did, that means
                      that every year we'd be making 10% of the value of the
                      <i>money</i> in our savings account. So for example, if I
                      were to put a hundred pounds in a savings account right
                      now the next year it would be worth 110. Then the year
                      after it will be 121 because it's 10% of then the 110, &
                      then it would be 130 something. This would very quickly
                      compound so that in 10 years time, my 100 pounds will have
                      become 259 pounds. If we adjust for <i>inflation</i> that
                      our <i>money</i> is still worth 206 pounds in 10 years
                      time, this is pretty good. We have more than doubled our
                      <i>money</i>, by just putting it in this hypothetical 10%
                      interest savings account. It really doesn't seem like it
                      would do that because 10% feels like a small amount of
                      <i>money</i>. But if you extrapolate 10% over 10 years you
                      actually double your <i>money</i>, which is pretty
                      awesome. Sadly these hypothetical 10% saving accounts
                      don't really exist, because it's just way too high & real
                      life is not that nice. These days, most savings accounts
                      in the UK & I imagine around the rest of the world as
                      well, offer less than a 1% savings rate, which means
                      you're actually still losing <i>money</i> over time. But
                      we do have other options to try & get us to this magical
                      Nirvana of like, you know, this 10% saving thingy. That is
                      where <i>investments</i> come in.

                    <h3>4. What is an <i>Investment</i>?</h3>
                    <p>
                      So point number four is what is an <i>investment</i>? The
                      answer is that an <i>investment</i> is something that puts
                      money in your pocket. For example, let's say you buy a
                      house for a hundred 1000 pounds & you want to rent it out
                      to people. There are two ways, that's an
                      <i>investment</i>. There are two ways you're making money
                      from it. Firstly, let's say you're charging some rent to
                      the people living in your house. Let's say you're charging
                      them 830 pounds a month. That becomes 10,000 pounds a
                      year. So every year you're making 10,000 pounds in rental
                      income, which is 10% of what you originally paid for the
                      house. That means that in 10 years time you'll have paid
                      off the a 100,000 pounds that you've put in because you're
                      making 10K a year. Beyond that every year you're just
                      making 10,000 pounds in pure profit. So that's pretty
                      good. But secondly, it's an <i>investment</i> because the
                      value of the house itself would probably rise over time.
                      In general, there is a trend in most developed countries
                      that house prices tend to rise over the longterm. So your
                      house will probably be worth more than a hundred thousand
                      pounds in 10 years time. In fact in the UK, historically
                      in the past, some people have said that house prices have
                      doubled every 10 years. So maybe your house is worth close
                      to 200,000 pounds. So you've made money off of the rental
                      income but you've also made money off of the
                      <i>capital gains</i> which is what we call it when an
                      asset increases in value over time. But the problem is
                      that buying a house is a little bit annoying. You need to
                      have quite a large amount of money for a deposit. You need
                      to get a mortgage. You need to actually have the house.
                      You just sought out the rental management, rent it out to
                      people, all that kind of stuff. If only there were a way
                      of investing without (a), having a large amount of money
                      to start with & (b), without having to put that much
                      effort into managing the assets as well. That brings us on
                      to investing in <i>shares</i>. For me, basically, a
                      hundred percent of my <i>investment</i> portfolio is
                      entirely <i>shares</i>. I have a tiny percentage in
                      Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, Cardano & I own some stocks
                      but I don't consider my Crypto as an <i>investment</i>.
                      I'll talk about that in a post.
                    </p>
                    <h3>5. What are <i>Shares</i>?</h3>
                    <p>
                      Therefore number five is what are <i>shares</i> & how do
                      they work? So buying <i>shares</i> probably as close as
                      we're ever gonna get to this magical savings account that
                      just returns some amount of money each year. The idea is
                      that when you buy a <i>share</i>, you are buying a part
                      ownership of the company that you've got the
                      <i>share</i> in. For example, let's say the Apple have a
                      particularly profitable year because lots of people have
                      well iPads as per recommendations & because Apple are
                      feeling kind, they are choosing to pay out a
                      <i>dividend</i> to their shareholders. So for example they
                      might say that they're gonna issue a <i>dividend</i> of a
                      million pounds, & that's gonna be split evenly amongst
                      whoever owns <i>shares</i> in Apple, based on how many
                      <i>shares</i> they own. So for example, if you happen to
                      own 1% of Apple you would get 1% of that
                      <i>dividend</i> that they've issued. So 1% of a million
                      pounds, which is 10,000 pounds obviously no one reading
                      this actually owns 1% of Apple, unless Tim Cook, you're
                      reading, I don't even know if you own that much because
                      that would make you an extremely rich person because Apple
                      is a very valuable company but that's basically how the
                      <i>dividend</i> thing works. A company decides to issue a
                      <i>dividend</i> as a way of returning some of its profit
                      back to the people who have invested in the company.
                      Therefore you make money through <i>dividends</i>. The
                      second way of making money from <i>shares</i> is sort of
                      like with houses in that you get the
                      <i>capital gains</i> over time. So for example, let's say
                      you bought 10 <i>shares</i> in Apple in 2010, at the time
                      those <i>shares</i> were selling for $9 each. So you spent
                      $90 on buying 10 <i>shares</i> in Apple. As of October,
                      2020, Apple <i>shares</i> sell for $115. So your 10
                      <i>shares</i> are now worth $1,150 just by the fact that
                      you only paid $90 for them 10 years ago.
                    </p>
                    <h3>6. How do I buy a <i>Share</i>?</h3>
                    <p>
                      Okay, so we've talked about what a <i>share</i> is & how
                      you make money from them. At this point you've probably
                      got a few questions like how much money you need to get
                      started or how <i>risky</i> is buying <i>shares</i> in a
                      company. I promise we're gonna get to that. But point
                      number six is how the hell do you buy a <i>share</i> in
                      the first place? This is where it can kind of get
                      complicated because it's not as simple as going on
                      <a href="https://www.apple.com/" target="_blank"
                        >apple.com/buy</a
                      >
                      & just buying a <i>share</i> in Apple. It doesn't quite
                      work like that. Instead you have to go through, what's
                      called a broker. Back in the day, a stockbroker was a
                      physical person usually a dude who you would call on the
                      phone & say "Hey, Bob, I want to place an order for some
                      <i>shares</i> in Apple." Then Bob would types & stuff into
                      his computer or a place like a paper order. Then you would
                      own <i>shares</i> in Apple. Thankfully these days we don't
                      really have to talk to Bob because there's loads & loads
                      of online brokers instead. So you make an account on an
                      online broker & then you can buy <i>shares</i> in a
                      company through that.

                    <p>
                      A bit annoyingly, every different country has their own
                      different brokers that operate in that country. Because to
                      be an online broker in a country you have to abide by like
                      a zillion different laws. So in the UK the system is
                      different to the U.S. which is different to Canada &
                      Germany & so on. The UK, for example, most banks do have
                      their own online brokerage type things. So with most bank
                      accounts you can also open an
                      <i>investment</i> account with them & then invest online.
                      But usually the interface is a bit clunky. It's a bit old
                      fashioned. So you're usually better off going with an
                      online broker. In the UK, the two that Ali Abdaal use are
                      Charles Stanley Direct & Vanguard, but before we get ahead
                      of ourselves & make an account on Vanguard or whatever, we
                      need to understand a few more things.

                    <h3>7. How do I decide which <i>Shares</i> to buy?</h3>
                    <p>
                      So question number seven is how the hell do I decide which
                      <i>shares</i> to buy? The easy answer to that is that you
                      actually don't want to figure out which <i>shares</i> to
                      buy. You do not want to buy individual <i>shares</i>. Why
                      it's not a good idea generally speaking to invest in
                      individual stocks, but essentially the issue with
                      investing in individual stocks is it's kind of
                      <i>risky</i>. Like, yes, if you invest in something like
                      Apple, chances are it's gonna be around 10 years from now.
                      But historically there've been quite a few companies that
                      people were like, "Oh my God, this is amazing. This is the
                      thing to invest in." Then that company went bust. So
                      you're automatically exposing yourself to more
                      <i>risk</i> if you're investing in individual stock, also
                      in general, like it's easy to say, hey, Amazon grew 10X in
                      the last 10 years. Therefore it's gonna continue to do the
                      same for the next 10 years. But that's trying to predict
                      the future. The past is no real indication of future
                      performance. So the advice that most people would give for
                      beginners is that you should not invest in individual
                      stocks.

                    <h3>8. What's an <i>index fund</i>?</h3>
                    <p>
                      You should invest in <i>index funds</i>. This is what
                      Graham Stephan, one of my favorite YouTubers also says as
                      well. He says, "The <i>index funds</i> are the best,
                      safest, & easiest longterm investment strategy for most
                      people." Which begs the question point number eight, what
                      the hell is an <i>index fund</i>? So there's basically two
                      bits to understand here there's the index bit & the fund
                      bit, let's start with the fund bit. A fund is basically
                      where investors will pool their money, so multiple
                      investors would invest in the same fund. Then that fund
                      would have a fund manager. The fund manager decides which
                      companies the fund is gonna invest in. For example, let's
                      say I were managing a fund & I called it Gringotts & let's
                      say a hundred people from my audience decided to invest in
                      my Gringotts fund. I as the fund manager can say, okay,
                      the Gringotts fund now that we have a hundred people's
                      money let's say it's a 100 million. So everyone's invested
                      1 million each I've now got a 100 million. I'm gonna put
                      20% of that in <i>Apple</i>, 10% in <i>Facebook</i>, 10%
                      in <i>Amazon</i>, 10% in <i>Tesla</i>, 10% of
                      <i>Netflix</i> 10% in <i>Johnson & Johnson</i>, all of
                      that sort of stuff.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      So you, the investor don't have to worry about this
                      because you trust me & my fund Gringotts to manage your
                      money. As you know, the fund performs well, because the
                      prices of these stocks & shares increases you get the
                      returns & I take a 1% or 2% management fee. So I make a
                      load of money because I'm earning 1% or 2% off of this 100
                      million that I'm managing & you're not worrying about
                      having to pick stocks yourself. You trust me as a seasoned
                      professional to do that for you. So that's what a fund is.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Now, the index bit refers to a stock market index. So a
                      stock market index would for example, be the FTSE 100
                      which is the a hundred biggest companies in the UK or the
                      <i>S&P 500</i>, which is the 500 biggest companies in the
                      U.S. or the NASDAQ or the Dow. These are all different
                      indices of the stock market. & If we use the
                      <i>S&P 500</i>, for example, these are the components of
                      the <i>S&P 500</i>. So we said, it's the 500 biggest
                      companies in the U.S. So number one is Apple & Apple makes
                      up 6.5% of the S&P, Microsoft makes up 5.5, Amazon makes
                      it 4.7, Facebook has 2.2, Alphabet, which is a Google
                      makes 1.5 & 1.5 is about 3% of the total <i>S&P 500</i>.
                      Essentially we've got these 500 companies if you go all
                      the way down... Oh, Ralph Lauren is 496, but chances are,
                      you've not really heard of many of the other ones at the
                      bottom of the list but chances are, you've heard of most
                      of the companies towards the top of the list. So the
                      <i>S&P 500</i> is an index of the U.S. stock market. If
                      you look at the performance as a whole of the
                      <i>S&P 500</i>, you get a general idea of how the U.S.
                      economy is going as a whole, started in 1980.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Since that time this is what the us stock market has been
                      doing. So as you can see, there is a general trend upwards
                      but for example in 2000, there was a bit of a crash, in
                      2008 famously there was a bit of a crash. Earlier this
                      year, when Corona was first starting to be a thing there
                      was a bit of a crash but then the market basically
                      immediately recovered after that. Okay, so we know what a
                      fund is, i.e. a way of pooling money. We know what the
                      index is, something like the <i>S&P 500</i>, when you
                      combine those, you get an <i>index fund</i> which is a
                      fund that automatically invests in all of the companies in
                      the index.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      So with me, for example basically most of my investments,
                      all of my money is in the <i>S&P 500</i>, which
                      effectively means that 6.5% of my investments are in
                      Apple, 5.5 in Microsoft, 4.7 in Amazon, 2.2 in Facebook,
                      3% in Google, 1.5 in Berkshire Hathaway & so on. So why is
                      this good? Well, it's good for a lot of reasons.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      So firstly <i>index funds</i> are really, really easy to
                      invest in. A big problem that beginners have to investing,
                      it's like, well, how the hell do I know which company to
                      invest in? How do I read a balance sheet? How do I do any
                      of this stuff? If you invest in an <i>index fund</i>, you
                      actually don't have to worry about any of that.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Secondly, <i>index funds</i> give you a decent amount of
                      diversification. There are all sorts of companies in the
                      <i>S&P 500</i>. So you're not entirely reliant on the tech
                      sector or the oil sector or the clothing sector or
                      anything to make the bulk of your money. You are very
                      nicely diversified across all these U.S. companies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Thirdly, <i>index funds</i> have very low fees. So because
                      it's not a real person who is deciding what to invest in &
                      doing all this research & trying to make loads of money is
                      essentially a computer algorithm that automatically
                      allocate your money based on the components of the index
                      fund. The fees for those are really low. & one of the main
                      things about investing for the longterm is that even a
                      slight increase in your fees is gonna massively impact
                      your financial upside.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      So for example, an <i>index fund</i> with a 0.1% fee is so
                      much better for you than an actively managed fund where a
                      fund manager is charging you even 1% because the longterm
                      difference between 0.1% fees & a 1% fee is sort of
                      absolutely astronomical over the long term. Finally, if
                      you look historically &, you know technically historical
                      performance is not the same thing as future performance,
                      but if you look historically very few funds have managed
                      to actually consistently beat the market i.e. outperform
                      the index. In fact, someone like Warren Buffett famously
                      says that if you gave him a hundred thousand pounds &
                      asked him to invest it right now he would just invest in
                      an <i>index fund</i>, like the <i>S&P 500</i>. In fact, in
                      2008 Warren Buffett challenged the hedge fund industry to
                      try & beat the market.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Warren Buffett said that hedge funds are a bit pointless
                      because they charge way too high fees & they don't
                      actually get the sort of returns they claim to get. So he
                      set up this 10 year bet which this company called Protege
                      Partners LLC accepted, where Buffett said that he was
                      gonna bet that the <i>index fund</i> outperformed the
                      actively managed fund. Warren Buffett ended up winning
                      that bet & sort of gave lots of money for charity or
                      something like that. But that just sort of goes to show
                      that it's really hard to beat the market with an actively
                      managed fund. Basically, no one can predict what the
                      market is gonna do in the future. Therefore if you hit
                      your ride on index, i.e. you're gambling on the entire
                      market, rather than thinking, you know what I've got some
                      amazing insight that I'll know exactly which 10 stocks to
                      pick that are gonna beat the market. You might as well hit
                      your ride with the whole market rather than individual
                      stocks.

                    <h3>9. Isn't investing <i>Risky</i>?</h3>
                    <p>
                      Okay, so we've sorted out the problem of which stocks to
                      invest in by completely circumventing the problem &
                      instead, just investing in index funds. The next big
                      question people usually have about investing in stocks &
                      shares is the amount of <i>risk</i>. That brings us to
                      point number nine. The argument usually goes as follows
                      that, "Hey, okay cool. This investing in stocks & shares
                      stuff. It sounds kind of interesting, but my uncle Tom
                      Cobley, invested lots of money in the stock market. He
                      lost a lot of money. My parents have told me that
                      investing in the stock market is a really
                      <i>risky</i> thing & I shouldn't do it. I should instead
                      invest in real estate because real estate is safe."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      That is usually the sort of thing, the sort of idea that
                      people have about investing in stocks. Naturally there is
                      the anxiety of what if I lose all my money. So let's talk
                      about that now. So if we take a step back, the only way to
                      lose money in anything is if you buy a thing & then you
                      sell it for less than you actually bought it. Like, let's
                      say you bought a house for 300,000 pounds, & then Brexit
                      happens the next day & the house prices plummet. Now your
                      house is only worth 250,000. At that point, if you decide
                      to sell your house, then yes you are losing money & you've
                      lost 50,000 pounds.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Equally, the only way to really lose money in stocks is if
                      you buy a stock at a certain price & then you sell it for
                      less than that price. So for example, let's say you bought
                      shares in Apple on the 18th of February, 2020. Let's say
                      you bought one share which time was $79 & 75 cents.
                      Because this is your first time in investing you keep on
                      looking at the price of the Apple stock because every time
                      are you thinking, oh, have I made money, have I made
                      money? Really annoyingly for you, you see that over the
                      next kind of few days a few weeks, Apple stock is actually
                      going down. Then on the 18th of March, 2020, you decide
                      screw it. I'm gonna sell my one share on Apple, because I
                      don't want to lose all my money. You sell it for a measly
                      price of $61.67. So you technically lost $18 because you
                      bought it at $79 in February, & you've sold it for $61 in
                      March. Then you think, damn, I've lost 20% of my
                      investment. This stock market thing is BS. I'm never gonna
                      invest in the stock market again, & you call it a day.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      This would be a very bad thing to do. Because for example,
                      if we look at Apple stock price in March, it was $57.31
                      but if you just held onto your one Apple share in that
                      time, what is it today? It's the 8th of October. Apple is
                      now trading at $114.96. So if you just held on for a few
                      months, you would actually made a lot of money. You would
                      have bought it at $79 & within, I don't know eight months,
                      it would now be worth $115. That's a pretty good game. So
                      the real lesson here is that when you're investing in
                      stocks & shares, & also when you're investing in real
                      estate, these are longterm investments. Ideally, you
                      shouldn't be putting any money into stocks & shares that
                      you need to access within the next five years. Actually a
                      lot of people would extend that to 10 years.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      It's exactly like that with house prices, it's like if you
                      buy a house as an investment, & then the houses house
                      prices go down it would be completely stupid of you to
                      sell the house unless you are absolutely desperate for the
                      money, because something major has happened. Instead, if
                      you just held onto the house then you would have made more
                      money in the long run because in the longterm house prices
                      always go up & in the longterm basically the stock market
                      always goes up & that's a bit of, it can be a
                      controversial statement, but for now take my word for it
                      that over the long term, the stock market always goes up.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      But having said that again, this is a longterm thing. For
                      example, if we look at the <i>S&P 500</i> & look at how it
                      was in 2008 at the financial crash right around 2007, it's
                      $1,500 per bit of the <i>S&P 500</i>. Then the crash
                      happens & then by February, 2009, it's down to $735. So
                      basically 50% of the value has been wiped off of the
                      <i>S&P 500</i>. Now, if you bought it in 2007 & you saw
                      it, you know, get a crushing & crashing & crashing, & then
                      you sold when it was $800. Now, you've lost a lot of money
                      because you bought high & you sold low.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      But if you just held on, it took let's see, to June 2007
                      it's at 1500s, it takes about up until 2013. So it takes
                      about five years for it to get back to its normal level.
                      Even if you'd invested, like just before the crash & then
                      your investment plummeted by 50%, if you would just held
                      on you'd have bought in at the <i>S&P 500</i> at 1500.
                      Right now it would be $3,445. So since 2008, 2007, when he
                      first invested over the last 13 years the
                      <i>S&P 500</i> has more than doubled. So you would have
                      more than doubled your money, provided you did not panic
                      sell when the market crashed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Now, hypothetically could the market crashed down to zero
                      & therefore you will actually lose all your money. Yes, it
                      could, but if the us stock market crashed literally to
                      zero i.e. all top 500 companies, including Apple, Google,
                      Microsoft, Facebook, like literally every company in the
                      top, in the <i>S&P 500</i>, all of those got destroyed
                      overnight. The stock market crashed to zero. The world
                      would be in some sort of mega apocalypse & you'd have a
                      lot more serious problems to worry about rather than the
                      value of your portfolio, of stock market indices on
                      Vanguard. In that scenario, in that doomsday scenario
                      money would stop meaning anything & you'd be using money
                      to wipe your bum because money has no value because the
                      stock market is completely crashed. It's basically
                      unfathomable that the global economy could be so
                      completely wrecked, such that every single company goes
                      down to zero.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      In my opinion, & again, you know, I'm not a financial
                      advisor. This is technically not financial advice whatever
                      that means, but in my opinion it's unrealistic to think
                      that if I put my money in stocks & shares, I could lose
                      all of it. There's basically no way you're ever gonna lose
                      all of it provided you're diversified. If you invested in,
                      I don't know, Myspace in 2000 & whatever it was, & then
                      Myspace crushes & then you've lost all your money because,
                      you know, they have no money, but if you invest in the top
                      500 companies in the U.S. or the top 500 companies in the
                      world, or the top 100 companies in the UK, it is so
                      vanishingly unlikely that you will ever lose your money.
                      That I don't think that is a <i>risk</i> that we should
                      even be thinking about. So realistic, worst case scenario,
                      yes, investing in the stock market is <i>risky</i> in the
                      short term, but if you're investing in the longterm, the
                      market will always go up & you will always end up making
                      more money in the long run provided you don't have to take
                      money out at inopportune times.

                    <h3>10. When should I get started?</h3>
                    <p>
                      Okay, so at this point, we've established that investing
                      in stocks is very good & investing in index funds is a
                      relatively safe way of doing this. The next question is
                      usually when should you get started? Like how old do you
                      have to be? Is it ever too soon to start? Is it ever too
                      late to start? Here the answer is pretty simple. Basically
                      all investment advice agrees with me on this front.
                      There's a very good website called
                      <a href="https://www.fool.com/" target="_blank"
                        >The Motley Fool</a

                      & they have a nice article explaining this. Basically, you
                      should start investing as soon as possible. It doesn't
                      matter how old you are. It doesn't matter how young you
                      are. The earlier you start investing the better. There are
                      three caveats though for like sensible financial advice.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Firstly, you wanna make sure that all of your high
                      interest i.e. credit card debt is paid off, because when
                      it comes to compounding even though gains compound, losses
                      compound as well. So if you've got like a 6% credit card
                      debt that's eating into your bottom line every single
                      month you want to pay that off as soon as possible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Point number two is that you want to make some sort of
                      emergency fund. People usually say that your emergency
                      fund should have in cash basically three to six months of
                      living expenses so that if you lose your job or if you're
                      hit with some kind of incredible medical emergency, &
                      you're not in the UK where medical care is free, or you're
                      in the U.S. or something like that, then you've got money
                      to do that. You don't have to take money out of your
                      investments.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Caveat number three is that you don't want to put any
                      money into stocks that you think you might need to use in
                      the next three to five years. So let's say you're 24 &
                      you've just landed your first job. You're thinking of
                      getting a mortgage & buying a house & you need money for
                      the deposit. Do not put that money into the S&P 500 or
                      into any kind of stocks & shares because no one can time
                      the market. No one knows whether we might you know, there
                      might be a market crash tomorrow. All we know is that in
                      the longterm, the stock market goes up, but if you need to
                      buy a house next year there is absolutely no guarantee
                      that that money will still be worth exactly the same or
                      worth more this time next year.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      So provided those two conditions are met. Like firstly,
                      you have<i> no high interest credit card debt</i>.
                      Secondly, you've <i>already got your emergency fund</i>.
                      Thirdly, you're
                      <i
                        >not planning to gonna have a major expense in the next
                        few years</i
                      >. At that point, absolutely everyone should be investing
                      something into the stock market. In my opinion, whether
                      you're 12 or 20 or 21 or 22 or 50, it doesn't matter. As
                      they say on the market floor there is almost no way your
                      future self will regret making the decision to invest.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      As you know at this point, this is because of compounding.
                      The more time you leave your money in the stock market,
                      the more it compounds. There is a huge difference. There's
                      like lots of interesting numbers about this on the
                      internet that people have calculated that if you start
                      investing at the age of 20, versus if you start investing
                      at the age of 25 or 30, it makes such a huge difference to
                      your bottom line. That basically, as soon as you read this
                      article & hear about investing, you should start investing
                      provided those three conditions that we talked about are
                      met.
                    </p>
                    <h3>11. How much money do I need to get started?</h3>
                    <p>
                      All right, so we're nearly there. Now, we're point 11 out
                      of 12 where we said, okay, you sold me on this idea of
                      investing in <i>index funds</i>. All of these three
                      conditions are met. I
                      <i>don't have a high interest credit card debt</i>. I've
                      <i>got my emergency fund</i>, or I'm a <i>student</i>.
                      Therefore my <i>parents are my emergency fund</i> & I'm
                      not planning to buy a house or a big thing in the next
                      three years. The next question is usually how much money
                      do I need to get started with investing?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      For worst case scenario, "I'm 14 years old & I don't have
                      any money. How do I get started with investing?" The
                      answer here is again, quite easy, basically start with
                      whatever you can. For some of these websites & some of
                      these apps that you can use to invest in stock market
                      indices. You can start with as little as $5 or 10 pounds,
                      depending on the website. You might need to start with a
                      100 pounds or a 1000 pounds. You can research this & it
                      kind of depends on which country you're in, but basically
                      you want to start investing as soon as possible. It
                      doesn't matter if it's a tiny amount of money to begin
                      with.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Firstly, it's useful to invest small amounts of money
                      because compounding is always good. But secondly & more
                      importantly, the sooner you start investing the sooner it
                      becomes a habit. So for me, for example, I started
                      investing in 2018 with the advice of my dear friend with a
                      family trust fund, Daniel Broutt. I knew absolutely
                      nothing about it before then, but I really wish I'd
                      started investing in like 2013 when I first had my first
                      part time job because (a), that would have encouraged good
                      financial habits within me. I would have kept aside maybe
                      10% or 20% from the top line to put into my investments.
                      Secondly, it would have meant that investing became a
                      habit. So I would have known about the fact that stock
                      market indices exist. I would have done the research. I
                      would have watched videos & read articles like this,
                      although these weren't as abundant in 2013.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      What I'm really annoyed about with myself is I started
                      making actual money in like 2015 & 2021 when my first
                      business started to do very well. Between 2015 & 2018, I
                      did not invest any money just because I didn't know that
                      you could, I didn't know how & I always kinda thought
                      that, "Huh, I'm making money now." It's just sort of
                      sitting in my bank account. I know that inflation is a
                      thing. So I know my money's losing value but I just didn't
                      think about investing & didn't realize how easy it is &
                      that it's a thing. So I really wish I'd started investing
                      my real money in 2015, but the only way I would've done
                      that is if I had started investing from 2013, when I first
                      started making, I don't know, fifteen dollars an hour
                      during my part time job.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      So again, & I can't state this emphatically enough. Like
                      it doesn't matter if all you have is a small amount to
                      invest even if it's one pound, even if it's $10. The
                      process of making the account & researching online
                      stockbrokers in your country & figuring out how to
                      actually do this stuff is the most valuable thing that you
                      could be doing with your time immediately after reading
                      this article.

                    <h3>12. How do I begin?</h3>
                    <p>
                      Finally, point number 12 is okay, I'm sold, I've got a 100
                      pounds here & I want to put it inside a
                      <i>stock market index fund</i>. How do I actually do that?
                      The answer here is you want to find an online broker. So
                      this will vary massively depending on which country you're
                      in, because these online brokers as I said, have like
                      zillions of laws they have to comply with & financial
                      regulations & all this stuff. In the U.S. most people that
                      I know use the Vanguard as well. My favorite blogger Mr.
                      Money Mustache recommends that as well. Although in the
                      U.S. there are also other services like Betterment, which
                      I'd bet a few friends who use that as well. Again,
                      depending on which country you're in, literally all you
                      have to do is Google the phrase, best online broker,
                      Germany, or best online broker, Iran, or best online
                      broker, India, whichever country you're in.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      You'll find something, read some reviews. Basically the
                      thing you're looking for is you want to be able to invest
                      in <i>index funds</i> & you want the fees to be as low as
                      possible. I think Charles Stanley Direct the fee is 0.25%
                      which was the lowest at the time when I made my account &
                      I think is still pretty competitive. So you want the fee
                      to be like a really, really, really small fraction of a
                      percentage. Then once you've made your account & verified
                      your identity & gone through all the hoops & stuff which
                      sometimes takes a few days, & they send you a letter to
                      the post to verify your address, like depending on what
                      the regulations are. Once you've done that then you can
                      start just putting money in here & there.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      All my friends that I've spoken to about this stuff over
                      the last, like couple years since I first started knowing
                      about investing in things, they've all started making
                      accounts & sort of making these investment accounts for
                      themselves. For the first few weeks they all sort of
                      compulsively check their phones to see what the stock
                      market is doing. But then very quickly you realize that
                      actually I'm investing for the long term here. I actually
                      don't give a toss what the stock market is doing in the
                      short term. I check my portfolio once every six months
                      just cause sometimes I'm curious. I don't even bother
                      looking at it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      This is very much a set it & forget it strategy, you're
                      investing for the longterm. Your money will magically grow
                      over time provided you don't touch it & think, "Oh crap,
                      the stock market's going down a bit. I'm gonna take my
                      money, because I can't handle these losses." There's loads
                      more to say about investing in finance, but hopefully this
                      was a reasonably concise, albeit not very concise. This is
                      gonna be a long article, but well, hopefully this was a
                      reasonable introduction to how to get started with
                      investing in <i>index funds</i>.
