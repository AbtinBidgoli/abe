                    <p>
                      Have you ever heard the phrase, the rich keep getting
                      richer & the poor are getting poorer? Well, it's not just
                      a phrase unfortunately it's the truth. Despite the fact
                      that millions of people are leaving poverty behind & even
                      becoming millionaires. Most people will never make it,
                      having said that in 2020, America's 614 billionaires net
                      worth exceeded 3 trillion dollars.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The stimulus bill that supposes to help your average folk
                      ended up helping the billionaires the most. At the end of
                      the day, most people spent that money either on their
                      basic needs or purchased some gadgets on amazon. I guess
                      Bezos was the ultimate beneficiary of the stimulus bill.
                      Even though he has stepped down as the CEO of Amazon, he
                      is still the biggest individual shareholder.

                      But the question that I want to focus on in this article
                      is ~ how do you get out of poverty? What if you are born
                      into a poor family, it's not your fault, what do you do?
                      How exactly do you build wealth & become financially free?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Understand that no one is going to help you except
                      yourself. There’s no difference. It's a blessing when
                      there is someone who can help you. Either it's the
                      government or your parents, but the reality is no one
                      really cares about you except yourself. Of course, your
                      parents want you to have a better life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      However, they don't always have the ability to provide you
                      with multiple opportunities, & if they have grown up in a
                      poor family, it's very unlikely that they can give you
                      good financial advice. Otherwise they would have gotten
                      out of that position long ago. If you talk to people who
                      are struggling financially, they will always blame
                      someone, especially the government who suppose to take
                      care of them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I am not saying that the government shouldn't take care of
                      you, but if you rely on outside factors, you will have to
                      wait for a long time. You have to make it crystally clear
                      to your self that no one can help you as much as you can
                      help yourself. That's the first step to make any
                      meaningful change.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Fear & Loathing for Complacency</h3>
                    <p>
                      Don't settle for a low paying job, I am not against
                      getting a job. In fact getting a low paying job when you
                      are a teenager is a perfect opportunity to teach yourself
                      the basics of business, money & learn how to be
                      responsible with money. However, a low paying job is a
                      trap that most people get into & never leave. When you
                      grow up poor, every penny matters, every dollar makes a
                      difference, you grow up with very little needs & wants.
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                      As my pops always says, "You don't have any
                      <i>money management</i>." The truth hurts, which he read
                      me like a book. I think about my father as a young man
                      back in Iran, driving his Peykan with his siblings &
                      frolicking with joy.
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
                      Everything you want can be fulfilled with a few thousand
                      dollars. All you want is a proper roof over your head,
                      some good food, & gadgets that everyone else around has.
                      So when you get that first job as a teenager, it provides
                      you with enough income to fulfill those needs, but in
                      return, you have to give up most of your time. So you get
                      to a position where you just work the entire day on a job
                      that doesn't provide you with skills to increase your
                      income year after year but at the same time fills your
                      basic needs at least, so you get trapped in that job. A
                      low paying job gives you instant gratification but a very
                      little reward in the long run. You can quickly earn enough
                      to be able to take a car on credit, get the latest iPhone
                      & start going out with friends.
                    </p>
                    <div class="media">

                    </div>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                      But, at the same time, it won't give you the luxury of
                      free time to work on yourself & make your time worth far
                      more valuable in the long run. Hence, you have to teach
                      yourself how to delay gratification. The best way to do
                      that is to start going to the gym. No matter who you are,
                      no one is going to see any progress after hitting the gym
                      once, or twice or an entire month. Real progress comes
                      after many months of hitting the gym at least 3-4 times a
                      week, & if you want to see a substantial difference, then
                      you might need to go to the gym for a few years, maybe.
                      That experience will teach you how to work hard for
                      something you will get years later.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Consolidate a Clear Plan of Action</h3>
                    <p>
                      Have a clear plan, if you don't have a plan of how you are
                      going to become financially independent, you will forever
                      be trapped in poverty. It doesn't matter how long that
                      goal is going to take. If you don't have the plan, you
                      won't have the discipline to save & invest. Let me just
                      give you a hypothetical example. Let's say you spend 50K a
                      year. If you don't know how you are going to create a
                      passive income of 50K, then you are wasting your time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      But how do you create such a plan? You have to buy assets
                      that generate income over time, it could be anything from
                      real estate to stocks to bonds or a business that can
                      function with minimal management. A 200K dollar house can
                      be rented for 2K dollars a month, for example, or 24K a
                      year. So, for you to become financially free, you need at
                      least to purchase two properties that will provide you
                      with a rental income of 48K dollars.
                      <i
                        >That's just one way to do it. There are a million other
                        ways</i
                      >. You can take a mortgage, for example, & let your
                      tenants pay the mortgage & have a small cash flow with
                      every property. Or you can consider the stock market,
                      where you can expect a 10 percent rate of return in the
                      long run.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      It doesn't matter what the plan is as long as it's there,
                      & it seems like it has a good chance to work. Whether you
                      are going to save 10% of your income to get there or 90
                      percent, it depends on you. But here is what most people
                      are going to say, my income barely covers the bills. How
                      am I possibly going to save that much & invest?
                    </p>
                    <h3>Focus on Educating Yourself</h3>
                    <p>
                      if you are making 50K a year, it's impossible to imagine
                      yourself making 200K, for example or half a million
                      dollars or a million dollars. Because you are comparing

                      making 20 dollars an hour, then you have to make at least
                      250 dollars an hour assuming you will work for 12 hours
                      every single day to be able to make seven figures, & as
                      far as it seems, no one is going to pay you that much for
                      a such a job.

                      However, that doesn't mean, there aren't ways to earn that
                      much. There are people who make far more than that, the
                      only problem is, you have to find out how! that's why you
                      have to educate yourself. But if you spend all your time
                      on a low-paying job, you won't be able to do that. So what
                      should you do, either find extra time after you are done
                      with your job or what I did back then is just minimize my
                      expenses, deny myself some of the nice to have things so
                      that I could work less to pay the bills & suddenly I had
                      some extra time to work on myself. If you are just
                      starting out, pick up some books, find out what your
                      strengths are, learn how the latest technologies work, &
                      start something in that field. It's not going to happen
                      overnight, but remember that you are in it for the long
                      run.

                    <h3>Begin Strategic Planning Process</h3>
                    <p>
                      Set up a boring but effective routine. Once you come up
                      with a reasonable plan of action, it's time to set up a
                      routine. <i>SWOT</i> analysis stands for Strengths,
                      Weaknesses, Opportunities, & Threats. To do a SWOT
                      analysis, you should focus on what you believe are the key
                      areas of imperfection. Once you have completed a SWOT
                      analysis, you should begin to develop goals for each of
                      the subpar areas of disappointment. The goals should be
                      specific, measurable, agreed-upon, realistic, & have a
                      time constraint.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Forget about having adventures every single day. You can't
                      be productive if you don't have a routine. That life you
                      see on Instagram is nonsense. Trust me, everyone who makes
                      real money almost never lives like that. The life of a
                      person who makes a lot of money is super boring! Yes, it's
                      boring but yet effective. You wake up every day at the
                      same time, do the same thing, over & over & over a long
                      period of time, which could be years, you achieve
                      meaningful progress.

                      Remember the example of the gym. Building a great body is
                      a result of going to the gym every day & repeating the
                      same excercises. Yeah, sometimes you try new equipment,
                      but overall you do pretty much the same thing. You train
                      your chest, back, biceps, shoulders at least once a week.
                      After 2 or 3 years of hitting the gym 3-4 times at least a
                      week, you start to see the fruits of your hard work.

                      That's how everything works in life, including wealth. So
                      don't feel miserable when you scroll through your
                      Instagram feed. Just focus on what you are good. We don't
                      choose how are we born. Some of us are lucky to be born
                      rich, while others aren't fortunate.

                      Being born poor in a first-world country like the United

                      earning thirty eight thousand to seven hundred dollars or
                      less I will optimize & receive 99.9 percent of my dividend
                      income tax free up to thirty eight thousand six hundred
                      dollars. If I'm fortunate at that point to be married &
                      I'm good to go then that could be as much as seventy seven
                      thousand two hundred dollars of dividend income tax free
                      which that's a pretty freakishly large dividend portfolio.

                      have no idea but to be my own devil's advocate I would get
                      a Roth IRA if one of two conditions were met condition:
                    </p>
                    <ol type="1">
                      <li>
                        I was employed & my employer would help me set one up &
                        actually match my contributions
                      </li>
                      <br />
                      <li>
                        I made so much money I didn't know what to do with it &
                        I would just invest it for some extra diversification
                        income in retirement

                      But that is kind of ironic because if you make a hundred
                      twenty two thousand dollars a year or more one of the
                      disadvantages is you can no longer contribute to your Roth
                      IRA.
